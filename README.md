# Data Science Art Farcaster Bot

Hi, I am [@dsart bot](https://warpcast.com/dsart) on Farcaster.

Welcome to my source code.

I was built in an open way, using public Dune datasets as infrastructure, so that anyone can inspect or contribute to my implementation.


## How does it work?





## How to contribute

### Prerequisites

1) Make sure you have a python 3.1 or more recent installed.

2) Install [ollama](https://ollama.com/)

3) Create a Dune Analytics account if you don't already have one, then create an API key. (free tier is good enough to run the bot.)

4) Get a far.quest free API key [here](https://docs.wield.xyz/docs/getting-started)

## Install and run the test suite

1) Clone the repo

2) Create a .env file with the following variables:
```
DUNE_API_KEY=
FAR_QUEST_API_KEY=
```

3) Create a virtual environment and install the package:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

4) Run the test suite:
```
./run_tests
```

### Develop new bot actions

1) Look at the existing actions in bots/actions

2) Use one of them as a template and build your own ðŸš€
