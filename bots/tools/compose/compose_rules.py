COMPOSE_DIRECTIVES = """
For your information, in the farcaster social media platform, posts are called casts.
You can optionally embed an url or a post hash if it is relevant. 
If your goal is about finding similar posts (more like this), use the first tweet for a freestyle intro (with or without an embed, a wordcloud or anything else) then fill embed_hash2 and embed_hash3 with similar posts ids.
If your goal is to pick a post, make sure you fill embed_hash1 to embed the post that you picked.
When you want to embed an url or post, use the embed_url or embed_hash fields, don't include the link or post id in the tweet field itself.
