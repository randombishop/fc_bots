You can optionally embed an url or a post hash if it is relevant. 
When you want to embed an url or post, use the embed_url or embed_hash fields, don't include the link in the tweet itself.
If the instructions are to find similar posts (more like this), use the first tweet for a freestyle intro (with or without an embed, a wordcloud or anything else) then fill embed_hash2 and embed_hash3 with similar posts ids.
