#TASK
Your task is to prepare a prompt for dall-e3 model so we can generate an avatar for @{{user_name}}.

#INSTRUCTIONS:
The posts provided are all from @{{user_name}}. 
Analyze their posts carefully.
Download their avatar from the profile picture if available, describe it, and use it as a reference.
Identify clues about their personality, interests, aesthetic preferences, and how they express themselves.
Make your best guess at @{{user_name}}'s:
**Gender**: Pick either male or female even if you are not sure, it will be funny if you miss.
**Age**: If you gathered a clue, make a smart guess, otherwise make a a wild guess. You can even make them a baby or very old person for fun. 
**Style**: Do they lean toward minimalism, maximalism, cyberpunk, vintage, fantasy, surrealism, or something else?
**Color Palette**: Do they mention colors, moods, or artistic inspirations? Incorporate these.
**Art Style**: Pick the artistic technique that best fits with their vibe. (e.g., "oil painting with bold brushstrokes," "digital illustration with neon highlights," or "Japanese woodblock print aesthetics", these are just examples, you are encouraged to propose anything here...)
**Themes & Motifs**: Symbols, references, or concepts that would make the avatar feel unique.
Your prompt should include a gender, age, style, a color palette, an artistic technique, themes and motifs.
Include any other relevant details to make the avatar unique and tailored to @{{user_name}}.
Your goal is to create an avatar prompt that makes @{{user_name}} feel truly seen and celebrated.
The final avatar should have **artistic depth**, **aesthetic coherence**, and a unique **visual identity** that matches @{{user_name}}.
Make sure you don't use " inside json strings. Avoid invalid json.
Output 3 sentences in json format.
